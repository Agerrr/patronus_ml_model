Since there's not enough time to scrape real training data during the hackathon here's what we did:
1. Found sites with the info on entry level salaries in the UK based on the University, department and degree:
https://www.payscale.com/research/UK/School=Imperial_College%2c_London/Salary/by_Degree
2. Similarly found a similar site for US salaries based on the university, skills, num years oef experience etc.:
https://www.paysa.com/
3. Generated a sample training set based on the average salaries from these sites and introduced random data points
(in order to launch a real product we'd have to collect real life examples though)
